<div class="line">                       Version 3, 29 June 2007</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line"> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http:<span class="comment">//fsf.org/&gt;</span></div>
<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of <span class="keyword">this</span> license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">                            Preamble</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license <span class="keywordflow">for</span></div>
<div class="line">software and other kinds of works.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  The licenses <span class="keywordflow">for</span> most software and other practical works are designed</div>
<div class="line">to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,</div>
<div class="line">the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</div>
<div class="line">share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</div>
<div class="line">software <span class="keywordflow">for</span> all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</div>
<div class="line">GNU General Public License <span class="keywordflow">for</span> most of our software; it applies also to</div>
<div class="line">any other work released <span class="keyword">this</span> way by its authors.  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge <span class="keywordflow">for</span></div>
<div class="line">them <span class="keywordflow">if</span> you wish), that you receive source code or can <span class="keyword">get</span> it <span class="keywordflow">if</span> you</div>
<div class="line">want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in <span class="keyword">new</span></div>
<div class="line">free programs, and that you know you can <span class="keywordflow">do</span> these things.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</div>
<div class="line">these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have</div>
<div class="line">certain responsibilities <span class="keywordflow">if</span> you distribute copies of the software, or <span class="keywordflow">if</span></div>
<div class="line">you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  For example, <span class="keywordflow">if</span> you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or <span class="keywordflow">for</span> a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</div>
<div class="line">freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive</div>
<div class="line">or can <span class="keyword">get</span> the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they</div>
<div class="line">know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</div>
<div class="line">(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you <span class="keyword">this</span> License</div>
<div class="line">giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  For the developers<span class="stringliteral">&#39; and authors&#39;</span> protection, the GPL clearly explains</div>
<div class="line">that there is no warranty <span class="keywordflow">for</span> <span class="keyword">this</span> free software.  For both users<span class="stringliteral">&#39; and</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">authors&#39;</span> sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</div>
<div class="line">changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</div>
<div class="line">authors of previous versions.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</div>
<div class="line">modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</div>
<div class="line">can <span class="keywordflow">do</span> so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</div>
<div class="line">protecting users<span class="stringliteral">&#39; freedom to change the software.  The systematic</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">modification follow.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  0. Definitions.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">works, such as semiconductor masks.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">on the Program.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">public, and in some countries other activities as well.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  1. Source Code.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">form of a work.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">is widely used among developers working in that language.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;</span>s</div>
<div class="line">System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</div>
<div class="line">programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</div>
<div class="line">which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</div>
<div class="line">includes <span class="keyword">interface </span>definition files associated with source files for</div>
<div class="line">the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</div>
<div class="line">linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</div>
<div class="line">such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</div>
<div class="line">subprograms and other parts of the work.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</div>
<div class="line">can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</div>
<div class="line">Source.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</div>
<div class="line">same work.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  2. Basic Permissions.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</div>
<div class="line">copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</div>
<div class="line">conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</div>
<div class="line">permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</div>
<div class="line">covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</div>
<div class="line">content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your</div>
<div class="line">rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</div>
<div class="line">convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</div>
<div class="line">in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</div>
<div class="line">of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</div>
<div class="line">with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</div>
<div class="line">the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</div>
<div class="line">not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</div>
<div class="line">for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</div>
<div class="line">and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</div>
<div class="line">your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</div>
<div class="line">the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</div>
<div class="line">makes it unnecessary.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  3. Protecting Users<span class="stringliteral">&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">measures.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;</span>s</div>
<div class="line">users, your or third parties<span class="stringliteral">&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">technological measures.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;</span>s source code as you</div>
<div class="line">receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</div>
<div class="line">appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</div>
<div class="line">keep intact all notices stating that <span class="keyword">this</span> License and any</div>
<div class="line">non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</div>
<div class="line">keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</div>
<div class="line">recipients a copy of <span class="keyword">this</span> License along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  You may charge any price or no price <span class="keywordflow">for each</span> copy that you convey,</div>
<div class="line">and you may offer support or warranty protection <span class="keywordflow">for</span> a fee.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</div>
<div class="line">produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</div>
<div class="line">terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</div>
<div class="line">    it, and giving a relevant date.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</div>
<div class="line">    released under <span class="keyword">this</span> License and any conditions added under section</div>
<div class="line">    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</div>
<div class="line">    <span class="stringliteral">&quot;keep intact all notices&quot;</span>.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under <span class="keyword">this</span></div>
<div class="line">    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This</div>
<div class="line">    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</div>
<div class="line">    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</div>
<div class="line">    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no</div>
<div class="line">    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</div>
<div class="line">    invalidate such permission <span class="keywordflow">if</span> you have separately received it.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</div>
<div class="line">    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, <span class="keywordflow">if</span> the Program has interactive</div>
<div class="line">    interfaces that <span class="keywordflow">do</span> not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</div>
<div class="line">    work need not make them <span class="keywordflow">do</span> so.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</div>
<div class="line">works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">in one of these ways:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    customarily used for software interchange.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">included in conveying the object code work.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">modification has been made.</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  7. Additional Terms.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">paragraph of section 11).</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">your receipt of the notice.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>

<div class="line">receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</div>
<div class="line">or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</div>
<div class="line">you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</div>
<div class="line">work and works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  A patent license is <span class="stringliteral">&quot;discriminatory&quot;</span> <span class="keywordflow">if</span> it does not include within</div>
<div class="line">the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</div>
<div class="line">conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</div>
<div class="line">specifically granted under <span class="keyword">this</span> License.  You may not convey a covered</div>
<div class="line">work <span class="keywordflow">if</span> you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</div>
<div class="line">in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</div>
<div class="line">to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</div>
<div class="line">the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</div>
<div class="line">parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</div>
<div class="line">patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</div>
<div class="line">conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</div>
<div class="line">for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</div>
<div class="line">contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</div>
<div class="line">or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</div>
<div class="line">any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</div>
<div class="line">otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</div>
<div class="line">covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</div>
<div class="line">not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</div>
<div class="line">to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</div>
<div class="line">the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</div>
<div class="line">License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</div>
<div class="line">permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</div>
<div class="line">under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</div>
<div class="line">combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</div>
<div class="line">License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</div>
<div class="line">but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</div>
<div class="line">section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</div>
<div class="line">combination as such.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  14. Revised Versions of this License.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</div>
<div class="line">the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>
<div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div>
<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the</div>
<div class="line">Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General</div>
<div class="line">Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the</div>
<div class="line">option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</div>
<div class="line">version or of any later version published by the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the</div>
<div class="line">GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</div>
<div class="line">by the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</div>
<div class="line">versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</div>
<div class="line">to choose that version for the Program.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  Later license versions may give you additional or different</div>
<div class="line">permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</div>
<div class="line">author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</div>
<div class="line">later version.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</div>
<div class="line">APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT</div>
<div class="line">HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line">OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,</div>
<div class="line">THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</div>
<div class="line">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM</div>
<div class="line">IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF</div>
<div class="line">ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  16. Limitation of Liability.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</div>
<div class="line">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS</div>
<div class="line">THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY</div>
<div class="line">GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE</div>
<div class="line">USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF</div>
<div class="line">DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD</div>
<div class="line">PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),</div>
<div class="line">EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF</div>
<div class="line">SUCH DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided</div>
<div class="line">above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,</div>
<div class="line">reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates</div>
<div class="line">an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the</div>
<div class="line">Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a</div>
<div class="line">copy of the Program in return for a fee.</div>
